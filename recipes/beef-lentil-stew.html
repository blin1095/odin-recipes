        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My mum is German and she would make this filling stew during the winter. We all loved it, so I thought I'd share!</p>
        <p>Creamy and filling stew made with carrots, beef, celery, lentils. Extremely filling and a well-balanced meal.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pound flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>4 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup dry lentils</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary</li>
            <li>11 ounces baby potatoes with skin</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Pour flour into a shallow bowl and dust steak with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat and sear beef on all sides until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, onion, celery, and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add more oil if necessary.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes with juice, lentils, beef broth, rosemary, and browned beef pieces to the skillet and stir well. Reduce heat, cover pot halfway with a lid, and simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes to the skillet. Simmer until lentils and potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            
        </ol>
